SimpleSurveyTool
================

Description
-----------
This is a simple surveying tool build in JS mostly on Bootstrap.  It allows users to click on a map to add their location.

Files
-----
* **README.md**: This file
* **createSurvey.js**: The JavaScript that creates all the buttons and input boxes
* **customLeaflet**: The Leaflet.js map and some associated code
* **customSurvey**: This is the file that contains all the survey questions
* **index.html**: Pulls it all together, and includes the title and location of the map
* **survey.css**: The styling for the survey.

Usage
-----
*This is a little tricky since Bootstrap is included as a submodule*

* git clone _this repo_
* git submodule init
* git git submodule update

Once you have it downloaded, you'll want to change the customSurvey.js file.  Descriptions of each file and what they do can be found above.

License
-------
_Since Bootstrap is included as a submodule, I feel that their license should be included._
